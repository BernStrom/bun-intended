### A DIY burger generator project üçî

A burger maker web application with ordering and checkout functionality. It utilizes the Firebase Realtime Database to store all available burger ingredients with a history of past orders submitted.

Disclaimer: _As this was more of a fun project rather than a real-life application, it was built merely for educational purposes to learn more about React state management through Redux, integrating Firebase database and converting from class to functional component using React hooks._
